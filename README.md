# objective
I created this repository with the aim of sharing the codes I created for the CodeSignal exercises with the intention of building a portfolio and receiving feedback. Not necessarily all the answers/codes will be uploaded here.

# how to use
I only upload codes that passed the Codesignal's tests. If you want to verify if a code passes its respective challenge, just copy and paste the code into the CodeSignal's IDE.
