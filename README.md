# objective
I created this repository with the aim of sharing the codes I created for the CodeSignal exercises with the intention of building a portfolio and receiving feedback. Not necessarily all the answers/codes will be uploaded here, but surely my favourite ones will.

# how to use
If you want to verify if a code passes its respective challenge, just copy and paste the code into the CodeSignal's IDE. However, the _<?php_ tag in the code will need to be removed.
